Damned islands, damned people with black souls, and as a result, black skin.
Only the skill of a great magician can save people who sell people.
These people serve evil and infect everyone who comes into contact with them with evil.
There are legends that sometimes there are birds in the sky that do not flap their wings and are of enormous size.
The gods punished these islands, black skin is a mark of evil.
The gods of our world are cruel and merciful. They reward for prayers and curse for sins.
One day a black man appeared on the island, the priests immediately pronounced this curse and Godâ€™s test, but many did not believe them. This man's name was Osama.
Women loved a black sinner named Osama, they disobeyed the prohibitions of their fathers, and brought even more evil into the world.
Generations succeeded each other, and after hundreds of years, the sin of their grandmothers haunts people.
Osama came from a distant country, brought by a storm. This storm destroyed crops, houses, felled trees, and flooded islands. This is a sign from God.
Osama's sons tried to find their father's homeland; they visited different islands. They carried the plague further.
I was also thrown onto the island, I lived on it for many years, and already as an old man I tell this story on the tablets.
